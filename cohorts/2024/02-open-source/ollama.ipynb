It is calculated as half the product of an object's mass (m) and its velocity (v) squared:\\n\\n**K = 1/2mv^2**\\n\\n**Potential energy (U)** is the energy an object possesses due to its position or configuration. It is calculated as the product of an object's mass, gravitational constant (g), and height or position above a reference point.\\n\\n**U = mgh**\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\n* **m** is the mass in kilograms (kg)\\n* **g** is the gravitational constant (9.8 m/s^2)\\n* **h** is the height or position in meters (m)\\n\\nThe formula shows that energy can be expressed as the sum of kinetic and potential energy. The kinetic energy is a measure of the object's ability to do work, while the potential energy is a measure of the object's ability to do work against a force.\""
